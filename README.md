# Main Idea:

Wanted to look at what statistics specific elite NHL players prosper in compared to their teammates and opponents, and if those advantages arise out of high opportunity given or chances made from the limited opportunity they recieve.


# Motivation:

In the years I’ve grown up watching hockey, the limelight was always on the top goal-scorers, leaders in points, or playoff MVP’s, but what about the second or third-line players around those stars? Are they getting equal opportunity or taking as many shots as their teammates? I wanted to look into what other statistics play a role in helping elite offensive talents, and what correlations can be found within these statistics. Focusing on the 2017-2018 NHL Regular Season, this project goes through entire team statistics, as well as individual statistics, to look into other parts of top goal-scorers games. Goals scored was the main variable used to compare to these other determining statistics, with six other major stats used as comparisons.


# Background Information:

I got my data from hockeyabstract.com, which has collected annual data from the last 12 years on NHL team and individual statistics. They compile data from around a dozen sources, including official NHL play-by-play stats and well-known statistic websites like hockeyreference.com.


# Results:
Results I found are that not many elite players are alike. Specifically on the second tab, "Top Shots", you see that of the 13 players who took the most shots in the 2017-18 NHL season, each tends to be higher than some in certain statistics (like Brent Burns goals scored for shots taken) but higher than their peers in others (Brent Burns number of assists for shots taken). On the first tab, a person can select any team in the NHL and see the statistics for every individual on that team, even if they only played one game. Some of the most interesting finds there were the Boston Bruin's top line dominance in opportunity over their teammates (Marchand-Bergeron-Pastrnak), Auston Matthews' ability to still be towards the top of the league in goals scored despite missing ~20 games, and the Vegas Golden Knights' depth in their forwards and defensemen to have all players (depending on position) in the same range for time on ice.
