# Main Question:

Is the number of goals or points an athlete gets the determingin factor how successful they are?


# Motivation:

In the years I’ve grown up watching hockey, the limelight was always on the top goal-scorers, leaders in points, or playoff MVP’s, but what about the second or third-line players around those stars? I wanted to look into the debate of how much an individual can truly carry a team. Focusing on the 2017-2018 NHL Season, this project goes through entire team statistics, as well as individual statistics, to try and understand if there are relationships or correlations to top goal-scorers. Goals scored was the main variable used to compare to these other determining statistics.


# Background Information:

I got my data from hockeyabstract.com, which had collected annual data from the last 12 years on NHL team and individual statistics.


# Questions to think with:

- Can an individual carry a team?
- If so, is that individual often the top goal-scorer on their team?
- Is the reason that certain players contribute more because they get more opportunities?

# Results:
